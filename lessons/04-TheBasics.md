## 04- The basics 
### Variables, types and assigments 


Now that you know how to write and run a simple hello world program, we will be diving into learning some of the meat and potatoes of the python programing language. 

#### Variables 

Variables are placeholders for a value in your computer program. They usually can be set and updated on the fly by your computer program. 
They usually look something like this :

``` x = 5 ``` or ``` name = "Alice" ```

The format for setting a variable is:
```[variable name] "=" [variable value]```
Your variable name can't have spaces in it and traditionally uses camel case format : "variableName" 

The value you assign can be letters, names or numbers. The different types of values that a variable can be is called **Variable Types** 

#### Variable Types

Variable types in python are :
- Text:
  - str (string)  
- Numeric Types:
  - int (interger)
  - float (float)
  - complex  (complex)
- Sequence Types:
  - list
  - tuple
  - range
- Mapping Type:
  - dict
- Set Types:
  - set
  - frozenset
- Boolean Types:
  - bool 
- Binary Types:
  - bytes
  - bytearray
  - memoryview
 - None Type:
  - NoneType 

Whoah that is a lot isn't it? Well don't worry about learning them all at once. That would be really hard and frustrating for a beginer.
For this course we will focused on the most used variable types. These variable types are the ones that you are most often be dealing with.
